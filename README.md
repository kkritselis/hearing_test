# earMeNow - Software Design Document (SDD)

## Project Overview

### Name
**earMeNow** - Web-Based Hearing Test Application

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide users with a simple, browser-based tool to assess their hearing range. The application plays tones at specific frequencies and allows users to respond to the sounds they can hear, generating a basic hearing profile report. It is not a substitute for a medical audiogram but can serve as an informative self-check.

### Target Audience
- Adults concerned about hearing loss
- Musicians or sound professionals
- General users interested in monitoring hearing health

### Platform
- HTML5 web application
- Compatible with modern browsers on desktop and mobile

### Core Features
- Pure-tone generation using Web Audio API
- Frequency and volume-based hearing threshold test
- Simple user interface with clear instructions
- Visual report (audiogram-style chart)
- Optional result export/download
- No user data collection by default

### Design Philosophy
- Clean, minimal, and professional
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Focus on accessibility and ease-of-use
